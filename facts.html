            <ol>
                <li>An Old Soul</li>
                    <p>Tolkien learned to read by the time he was four, with his mother allowing him to read as much as he wanted. He has said
                    that he didn’t like Treasure Island or The Pied Piper of Hamelin and that he found Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland
                    “amusing but disturbing.”</p>
                <li>An Unexpected Journey</li>
                    <p>An employee at the London publishing firm George Allen & Unwin convinced Tolkien to submit The Hobbit for publication.
                    Adults and children alike fell for the story when it was published a year later in 1937, so much so that the publishing
                    company requested a sequel! Tolkien had actually written The Hobbit for his own children many years prior.</p>
                <li>Then There Were Three</li>
                    <p>The Lord of the Rings would take Tolkien ten years to create and write, and were published in three volumes between 1954
                    and 1955. He had originally intended them to be one novel and didn’t like that they were turned into a trilogy.
                    Regardless, the books would go on to become some of the most popular works of the 20th century, both in sales and reader
                    surveys.</p>
                <li>Unplanned</li>
                    <p>Tolkien really had no clear plan when he started the books. He had no idea where the story would be going when he
                    started writing it, leaving many characters underdeveloped and the structure unlike other works of fiction.</p>
                <li>The trail of red</li>
                    <p>Tolkien delayed the publication of The Lord of the Rings because of a dispute over ink colors. He was going to leave his
                    publisher, Allen & Unwin because another publisher would use the red ink he wanted. He had made a plan that whenever the
                    writing on the ring would appear, it would be printed in red. When that deal fell through, he stuck it out with his
                    original publisher.</p>
                <li>The First will be the Last</li>
                    <p>Quite a number of unpublished works and notes written by Tolkien were published after his death by his son Christopher,
                    including The Silmarillion. That work was one of the first things that Tolkien ever wrote.</p>
                <li>Inspired by Real Events</li>
                    <p>Fighting in the wars helped shape some of his characters. Sam Gamgee, for example, was based on the ordinary soldiers
                    that he was in command of, who felt no anger or bitterness despite the conditions they were forced into.</p>
                <li>Secret Code</li>
                    <p>During the war, Tolkien created his own secret code, which is no surprise, considering how many languages he spoke and
                    created. He communicated with his wife this way, so she knew that he was okay. However, the soldiers weren’t supposed to
                    be communicating with people outside the war, as letting others know their locations was prohibited. We hope he never
                    got in any trouble for it!</p>
                <li>Life After The War</li>
                    <p>After World War I, Tolkien had a pretty interesting job for a while. He helped work on the Oxford English Dictionary,
                    which had started in 1879! He mainly worked on Germanic words that began with “W,” discovering their history and
                    etymology.</p>
                <li>Club in the Pub</li>
                    <p>He was part of a group of writers who called themselves “The Inklings.” Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, Charles Williams and Owen
                    Barfield met every Tuesday for lunch at an Oxford pub called the “Eagle and Child,” and read each other pages from their
                    books. Oh, to be a fly on the wall there!</p>
                <li>Time for Tea</li>
                    <p>He was a member of an interesting club while in college called the Tea Club and Barrovian Society. Perhaps obviously,
                    one of the activities that they would partake in was drinking tea, both by the school and in the library.</p>
                <li>Beer Connoisseur</li>
                    <p>While he was in college, he also developed a fondness for beer, and was known for staying up well into the night, and
                    sometimes maybe morning, just talking. Ah, to have the energy and the capacity to avoid hangovers of a college student.
                    He also felt like he needed to keep up with the richer students, and put himself into a bit of debt while doing so.
                    We’ve all been there, J.R.R.</p>
                <li>Ranking 3rd</li>
                    <p>As of 2004, The Lord of the Rings had been translated into at least 25 different languages and had sold 100 million
                    copies worldwide. It’s the third best-selling book of all time, behind The Bible at number one, and Quotations from the
                    Works of Mao Tse-Tung at number two.</p>
                <li>From Pages to the Big Screen</li>
                    <p>Tolkien sold the rights to his novels for film long before he died, but he never thought they would do well on screen.
                    He just didn’t think they could be successfully translated! We think they did pretty well, despite his son’s criticism
                    of them. Christopher Tolkien believes that the film adaptations were made as they were to appeal to the
                    sword-fight-loving crowd.</p>
                <li>Almost Snatched</li>
                    <p>Tolkien was born in Orange Free State, South Africa, and his family moved to England when he was three. When he was a
                    baby, he was kidnapped just for one day by a house-boy who was fascinated by him.</p>
                <li>Orphaned at a young age</li>
                    <p>Sadly, Tolkien’s parents died when he was young. He was only four when his father passed, and 12 when his mom died. He
                    and his brothers would be raised by a Catholic priest, as per his mother’s will. As a convert to Catholicism, she feared
                    her sons would be raised by her Protestant family members otherwise.</p>
                <li>Religious Writings</li>
                    <p>Tolkien was a devout Roman Catholic and found religion so important that he incorporated it into much of his writings.</p>
                <li>A natural polyglot</li>
                    <p>Tolkien’s mother taught him Latin, French and German, and while in school he either was taught or taught himself Greek,
                    Middle English, Old English (or Anglo Saxon), Old Norse (or Old Icelandic), Gothic, Modern and medieval Welsh, Finnish,
                    Spanish, and Italian. He also had a working knowledge of Serbian, Russian, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Dutch, and
                    Lombardic. He must have run out of languages to learn because he then created 14 different languages and alphabets for
                    Middle Earth. Meanwhile, the rest of us spend our days severely neglecting the Duolingo owl.</p>
                <li>The Language or Story</li>
                    <p>As is quite clear from the above fact, Tolkien loved languages and was a philologist or someone who studied the history
                    and culture of languages. He once said, “the invention of languages is the foundation. The ‘stories’ were made rather to
                    provide a world for the languages than the reverse.” Does this mean he created all of those languages before he wrote
                    the books? It’s like the new chicken or the egg debate.</p>
                <li>Green Thumb</li>
                    <p>Not only did his mother introduce reading, books, and languages to him at an early age, she also encouraged him to
                    explore botany. She wanted him to enjoy plants, from their look to their feel and everything in between.</p>
                <li>Growing with so many talents</li>
                    <p>He seems like he was a creative child. Along with learning all about languages, plants and such, he also enjoyed drawing
                    landscapes and trees.</p>
                <li>He's also a teacher</li>
                    <p>Along with attending Oxford University, he also taught there between 1925 and 1959. This was after he taught at the
                    University of Leeds. His contract at Oxford only called for him to teach 36 lectures a year, but he would do between 70
                    and 136!</p>
                <li>Inspirations from teaching</li>
                    <p>The very first line of The Hobbit came to him while he was grading papers. “In a hole in the ground lived a hobbit” was
                    scribbled onto a page of blank exam paper. The rest, as they say, is history!</p>
                <li>Tolkien Inspired Band</li>
                    <p>1980s British rock band Marillion borrowed their name from The Silmarillion. The band’s original drummer Mick Pointer
                    was a huge Tolkien fan. Another British rock band, Barclay James Harvest, recorded a single record under the pseudonym
                    “Bombadil” in 1972 and recorded the song “Galadriel” a year earlier. Before that, Trekkie Leonard Nimoy had recorded
                    “The Ballad of Bilbo Baggins” in the 1960s.</p>
                <li>Beren and Luthien</li>
                    <p>Tolkien passed away two years after his wife, but the pair are buried together in a single grave in the northern suburbs
                    of Oxford. The headstone reads “Edith Mary Tolkien, Lúthien, 1889-1971” and “John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, Beren,
                    1892-1973.” For you non-Silmarillion fans out there, Lúthien and Beren are lovers from that novel.</p>
                <li>Star Crossed Lovers</li>
                    <p>The life-long couple almost never got together. Tolkien was only 16 when he met a 19-year-old Edith, and his guardian
                    forbade him from seeing her until he was 21. She was even engaged to another man when they did get back together!</p>
                <li>Still Ranking from the grave</li>
                    <p>In 2002, Tolkien was ranked at 92 on the BBC Network’s 100 Greatest Britons. The rankings were based on a poll of
                    viewers. In 2008, he was ranked sixth out of 50 British writers since 1945 by British newspaper The Times. Finally, he
                    was ranked fifth in a Forbes list of top-earning dead celebrities in 2009.</p>
                <li>Royalty Recognized</li>
                    <p>Just one year before he passed, Tolkien was given the Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services to
                    literature by the Queen. Well deserved, we think!</p>
                <li>Presence of Royalty</li>
                    <p>That wasn’t the first time he was in the presence of royalty. When he was a scholarship student at King Edward’s School,
                    he was a cadet in the school’s Officers Training Corps. Along with the other cadets, he helped line the parade route
                    during King George V’s coronation in 1910. Their post was just outside of Buckingham Palace.</p>
                <li>Friends till the end</li>
                    <p>Tolkien was great friends with fellow author C.S. Lewis, so much so that his wife felt jealous by how close they were.
                    Tolkien had convinced Lewis to return to Christianity, but things took a bit of a turn. Tolkien was under the belief
                    that his friend was becoming anti-Christian, and didn’t approve of his lifestyle (Lewis was seeing an American
                    divorcée). After Lewis’ death, Tolkien wrote a letter to his daughter, regretting the distance between the two old pals,
                    saying “So far I have felt … like an old tree that is losing all its leaves one by one: this feels like an axe-blow near
                    the roots.”</p>
                <li>A devout Catholic</li>
                    <p>Devoted to Catholicism, Tolkien took much offense at new rules that the Vatican was imposing. Masses were starting to be
                    performed in English instead of Latin as a result of one of the changes, and he wasn’t happy. While others around him
                    responded in English, he continued to speak Latin, and he spoke loud enough so everyone would hear him.</p>
                <li>Religious and prayerful</li>
                    <p>Tolkien was so immersed in his religion that he made his son learn and memorize the entire Mass, among many other
                    prayers. He believed in praying often and receiving communion, and could often be found at a church mass. Tolkien told
                    of a time when he was praying and God came to him, showing him his guardian angel.</p>
                <li>Into Politics</li>
                    <p>Not only was he outspoken about religion, but he also didn’t think too highly of certain politicians or parties. In
                    fact, he said that he leaned towards anarchy, and was critical about not just Hitler, but Joseph Stalin as well.</p>
                <li>He didn't like autographs</li>
                    <p>It was a rarity if you had a signed copy of one of Tolkien’s books, as he hardly ever signed them. He just didn’t like
                    to! There are a number of forgeries out there, but some genuine copies do exist. In fact, a 1937 first edition hard copy
                    of The Hobbit that was signed was offered for sale for $85,000.</p>
                <li>Tolkien Reading Day</li>
                    <p>We can all celebrate Tolkien on March 25. This day was designated by The Tolkien Society as Tolkien Reading Day in 2003.
                    Get your books ready! Who’s joining us on a read-a-long?</p>
                <li>Military Vet</li>
                    <p>Tolkien was a veteran of WWI, fighting in the Battle of the Somme. He served in the Lancashire Fusiliers until he was
                    discharged in 1917 because of “trench fever.” All but one of his friends died fighting in the war.</p>
                <li>Wizard Codebreaker</li>
                    <p>In World War I, Tolkien was a signal officer and almost returned to help during World War II, where he had been
                    earmarked as a codebreaker. One of his sons would also join the army, and when applying, wrote his father’s occupation
                    as “wizard.”</p>
                <li>Arachnophobe</li>
                    <p>Tolkien had no memory of it, but he was bitten by a baboon spider, a type of tarantula, in a garden when he was a child.
                    I don’t want to look up a picture of this creature, simply because I’m terrified of spiders, but it sounds horrifying!
                    The author wasn’t afraid of spiders as he grew older though, and he the incident was likely an inspiration for some of
                    the monsters in his writings, à la Shelob.</p>
                <li>That time he drove an Old Jo</li>
                    <p>Although we can’t imagine a time without cars, Tolkien’s generation could. He wasn’t exactly known for being a great
                    driver either when he was behind the wheel. There was one instance when he was driving Old Jo, the family car, on two
                    flat tires and ended up, well, smashing it into a wall. It’s reported that he would drive straight through crowds
                    yelling “Charge them and they scatter!” Tolkien eventually gave up driving, believing cars to be bad for the
                    environment. That was probably a good decision all around.</p>
                <li>Pure blood</li>
                    <p>He had a bit of a quarrel with the Nazis when The Lord of the Rings was getting ready to be published in Germany. The
                    Nazis would only publish the books if Tolkien proved his lineage was pure. The writer penned many letters to send back
                    to them in response, with one such letter reading that he: “should regret giving any color to the wholly pernicious and
                    unscientific race-doctrine,” and also that he had “many Jewish friends.”</p>
                <li>Ruddy Little Ignoramus</li>
                    <p>He wasn’t a fan of Adolf Hitler in general, either. He once called the dictator a “ruddy little ignoramus,” and
                    expressed his wish that he had Jewish ancestry. The Tolkien family had left Germany in the 1800s, with the name Tolkien
                    originating from the German word tollkühn, which translated meant “foolhardy.”</p>
                <li>He had a flair for the dramatic</li>
                    <p>As a linguist and expert on Old English and Old Norse literature, Tolkien was a professor at Oxford University from 1925
                    until 1959. He was also a tireless instructor, teaching between 70 and 136 lectures a year (his contract only called for
                    36). But the best part is the way he taught those classes. Although quiet and unassuming in public, Tolkien wasn't the
                    typical stodgy, reserved stereotype of an Oxford don in the classroom. He went to parties dressed as a polar bear,
                    chased a neighbor dressed as an axe-wielding Anglo-Saxon warrior, and was known to hand shopkeepers his false teeth as
                    payment. As one of his students put it, "He could turn a lecture room into a mead hall."</p>
                <li>He felt so many of his fans are "lunatics"</li>
                    <p>Tolkien saw himself as a scholar first and a writer second. The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings were largely Tolkien's
                    attempt to construct a body of myth, and their success caught him largely unaware. In fact, he spent years rejecting,
                    criticizing, and shredding adaptations of his work that he didn't believe captured its epic scope and noble purpose. He
                    was also utterly skeptical of most LOTR fans, who he believed were incapable of really appreciating the work, and he
                    probably would have been horrified by movie fandom dressing up like Legolas.</p>
                <li>Unlike most people, Tolkien loved his day job</li>
                    <p>To Tolkien, writing fantasy fiction was simply a hobby. The works he considered most important were his scholarly works,
                    which included Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics, a modern translation of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, and A
                    Middle English Vocabulary.</p>
                <li>He is a romantic</li>
                    <p>At age 16, Tolkien fell in love with Edith Bratt, three years his senior. His guardian, a Catholic priest, was horrified
                    that his ward was seeing a Protestant and ordered the boy to have no contact with Edith until he turned 21. Tolkien
                    obeyed, pining after Edith for years until that fateful birthday, when he met with her under a railroad viaduct. She
                    broke off her engagement to another man, converted to Catholicism, and the two were married for the rest of their lives.
                    At Tolkien's instructions, their shared gravestone has the names "Beren" and "Luthien" engraved on it, a reference to
                    a famous pair of star-crossed lovers from the fictional world he created.</p>
                <li>Peculiar relationship with C.S. Lewis</li>
                    <p>Tolkien's fellow Oxford don C.S. Lewis (author of The Chronicles of Narnia) is often identified as his best friend and
                    closest confidant. But the truth is, the pair had a much more troubled relationship. At first, the two authors were very
                    close. In fact, Tolkien's wife Edith was reportedly jealous of their friendship. And it was Tolkien who convinced Lewis
                    to return to Christianity. But their relationship cooled over what Tolkien perceived as Lewis's anti-Catholic leanings
                    and scandalous personal life (he had been romancing an American divorcee at the time). Although they would never be as
                    close as they were before, Tolkien regretted the separation. After Lewis died, Tolkien wrote in a letter to his daughter
                    that, “So far I have felt ... like an old tree that is losing all its leaves one by one: this feels like an axe-blow
                    near the roots.”</p>
                <li>He loved clubbing</li>
                    <p>Well, the extra-curricular, after-school sort. Wherever Tolkien went, he was intimately involved in the formation of
                    literary and scholarly clubs. As a professor at Leeds University, for example, he formed the Viking Club. And during his
                    stint at Oxford, he formed the Inklings, a literary discussion group.</p>
                <li>A true soldier</li>
                    <p>Tolkien was a veteran of the First World War, and served as a second lieutenant in the 11th (Service) Battalion of the
                    British Expeditionary Force in France. He was also present for some of the most bloody trench fighting of the war,
                    including the Battle of the Somme. The deprivations of Frodo and Sam on their road to Mordor may have had their origins
                    in Tolkien's time in the trenches, during which he contracted a chronic fever from the lice that infested him and was
                    forced to return home. He would later say that all but one of his close friends died in the war, giving him a keen
                    awareness of its tragedy that shines through in his writing.</p>
                <li>Invented languages for fun</li>
                    <p>A philologist by trade, Tolkien kept his mind exercised by inventing new languages, many of which (like the Elvish
                    languages Quenya and Sindarin) he used extensively in his writing. He even wrote songs and poems in his fictional
                    languages. In addition, Tolkien worked to reconstruct and write in extinct languages like Medieval Welsh and Lombardic.
                    His poem "BagmÄ“ BlomÄ" ("Flower of the Trees") might be the first original work written in the Gothic language in
                    over a millennium.</p>
                <li>Publishing posthumously</li>
                    <p>Most authors have to be content with the works they produce during their lifetime, but not Tolkien. His scribblings and
                    random notes, along with manuscripts he never bothered to publish, have been edited, revised, compiled, redacted, and
                    published in dozens of volumes after his death, most of them produced by his son Christopher. While Tolkien's most
                    famous posthumous publication is The Silmarillion, other works include The History of Middle Earth, Unfinished Tales,
                    The Children of Hurin, and The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún.</p>
                <li>Foolhardy</li>
                    <p>The Tolkien name was derived from German. Tolkien (who was fascinated with languages said the surname came from the
                    German word tollkühn, meaning "foolhardy"</p>
                <li>Born in Africa</li>
                    <p>Tolkien was born in Orange Free State, South Africa, but moved to England aged three.</p>
                <li>Catholic convert</li>
                    <p>Tolkien became a Catholic in 1900, this caused a family rift with his Baptist relatives.</p>
                <li>Worked on Dictionary</li>
                    <p>In 1918, he got a job working on the Oxford English Dictionary, which had begun in 1879.</p>
                <li>Saved by a fever</li>
                    <p>Tolkien was saved from further fighting through developing trench fever. Though he later recalled that most of his
                    friends died in the First World War.</p>
                <li>He was a great lecturer</li>
                    <p>Tolkien was a great lecturer. When giving lectures on Beowulf, he would often startle students by exclaiming in
                    Anglo-Saxon and speaking in the manner of an old bar.</p>
                <li>Bedtime stories for his children</li>
                    <p>The Hobbit was written initially for his own children.</p>
                <li>Anti-piracy</li>
                    <p>When an American company published an authorised copy of 'Lord of the Rings' It became a best-seller. But, because
                    Tolkien maintained a long correspondence with many fans, he helped to encourage people to boycott the pirated copy. This
                    boycott proved successful and eventually, the company made a donation to Tolkien and dropped the edition.</p>
                <li>Passing on to Christopher</li>
                    <p>Tolkien left a significant body of work unpublished, which his son Christopher Tolkien later published. This included
                    The Silmarillion, The History of Middle Earth and Unfinished Tales.</p>
                <li>One of the Greatest Britons</li>
                    <p>Tolkien was voted 94th on the list of Greatest Britons</p>
