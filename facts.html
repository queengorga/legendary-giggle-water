                <li>An Old Soul</li>
                    <p>Tolkien learned to read by the time he was four, with his mother allowing him to read as much as he wanted. He has said
                    that he didn’t like Treasure Island or The Pied Piper of Hamelin and that he found Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland
                    “amusing but disturbing.”</p>
                <li>An Unexpected Journey</li>
                    <p>An employee at the London publishing firm George Allen & Unwin convinced Tolkien to submit The Hobbit for publication.
                    Adults and children alike fell for the story when it was published a year later in 1937, so much so that the publishing
                    company requested a sequel! Tolkien had actually written The Hobbit for his own children many years prior.</p>
                <li>Then There Were Three</li>
                    <p>The Lord of the Rings would take Tolkien ten years to create and write, and were published in three volumes between 1954
                    and 1955. He had originally intended them to be one novel and didn’t like that they were turned into a trilogy.
                    Regardless, the books would go on to become some of the most popular works of the 20th century, both in sales and reader
                    surveys.</p>
                <li>Unplanned</li>
                    <p>Tolkien really had no clear plan when he started the books. He had no idea where the story would be going when he
                    started writing it, leaving many characters underdeveloped and the structure unlike other works of fiction.</p>
                <li>The trail of red</li>
                    <p>Tolkien delayed the publication of The Lord of the Rings because of a dispute over ink colors. He was going to leave his
                    publisher, Allen & Unwin because another publisher would use the red ink he wanted. He had made a plan that whenever the
                    writing on the ring would appear, it would be printed in red. When that deal fell through, he stuck it out with his
                    original publisher.</p>
                <li>The First will be the Last</li>
                    <p>Quite a number of unpublished works and notes written by Tolkien were published after his death by his son Christopher,
                    including The Silmarillion. That work was one of the first things that Tolkien ever wrote.</p>
