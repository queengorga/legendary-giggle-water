            <ol>
                <li>An Old Soul</li>
                    <p>Tolkien learned to read by the time he was four, with his mother allowing him to read as much as he wanted. He has said
                    that he didn’t like Treasure Island or The Pied Piper of Hamelin and that he found Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland
                    “amusing but disturbing.”</p>
                <li>An Unexpected Journey</li>
                    <p>An employee at the London publishing firm George Allen & Unwin convinced Tolkien to submit The Hobbit for publication.
                    Adults and children alike fell for the story when it was published a year later in 1937, so much so that the publishing
                    company requested a sequel! Tolkien had actually written The Hobbit for his own children many years prior.</p>
                <li>Then There Were Three</li>
                    <p>The Lord of the Rings would take Tolkien ten years to create and write, and were published in three volumes between 1954
                    and 1955. He had originally intended them to be one novel and didn’t like that they were turned into a trilogy.
                    Regardless, the books would go on to become some of the most popular works of the 20th century, both in sales and reader
                    surveys.</p>
                <li>Unplanned</li>
                    <p>Tolkien really had no clear plan when he started the books. He had no idea where the story would be going when he
                    started writing it, leaving many characters underdeveloped and the structure unlike other works of fiction.</p>
                <li>The trail of red</li>
                    <p>Tolkien delayed the publication of The Lord of the Rings because of a dispute over ink colors. He was going to leave his
                    publisher, Allen & Unwin because another publisher would use the red ink he wanted. He had made a plan that whenever the
                    writing on the ring would appear, it would be printed in red. When that deal fell through, he stuck it out with his
                    original publisher.</p>
                <li>The First will be the Last</li>
                    <p>Quite a number of unpublished works and notes written by Tolkien were published after his death by his son Christopher,
                    including The Silmarillion. That work was one of the first things that Tolkien ever wrote.</p>
                <li>Inspired by Real Events</li>
                    <p>Fighting in the wars helped shape some of his characters. Sam Gamgee, for example, was based on the ordinary soldiers
                    that he was in command of, who felt no anger or bitterness despite the conditions they were forced into.</p>
                <li>Secret Code</li>
                    <p>During the war, Tolkien created his own secret code, which is no surprise, considering how many languages he spoke and
                    created. He communicated with his wife this way, so she knew that he was okay. However, the soldiers weren’t supposed to
                    be communicating with people outside the war, as letting others know their locations was prohibited. We hope he never
                    got in any trouble for it!</p>
                <li>Life After The War</li>
                    <p>After World War I, Tolkien had a pretty interesting job for a while. He helped work on the Oxford English Dictionary,
                    which had started in 1879! He mainly worked on Germanic words that began with “W,” discovering their history and
                    etymology.</p>
                <li>Club in the Pub</li>
                    <p>He was part of a group of writers who called themselves “The Inklings.” Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, Charles Williams and Owen
                    Barfield met every Tuesday for lunch at an Oxford pub called the “Eagle and Child,” and read each other pages from their
                    books. Oh, to be a fly on the wall there!</p>
                <li>Time for Tea</li>
                    <p>He was a member of an interesting club while in college called the Tea Club and Barrovian Society. Perhaps obviously,
                    one of the activities that they would partake in was drinking tea, both by the school and in the library.</p>
                <li>Beer Connoisseur</li>
                    <p>While he was in college, he also developed a fondness for beer, and was known for staying up well into the night, and
                    sometimes maybe morning, just talking. Ah, to have the energy and the capacity to avoid hangovers of a college student.
                    He also felt like he needed to keep up with the richer students, and put himself into a bit of debt while doing so.
                    We’ve all been there, J.R.R.</p>
                <li>Ranking 3rd</li>
                    <p>As of 2004, The Lord of the Rings had been translated into at least 25 different languages and had sold 100 million
                    copies worldwide. It’s the third best-selling book of all time, behind The Bible at number one, and Quotations from the
                    Works of Mao Tse-Tung at number two.</p>
                <li>From Pages to the Big Screen</li>
                    <p>Tolkien sold the rights to his novels for film long before he died, but he never thought they would do well on screen.
                    He just didn’t think they could be successfully translated! We think they did pretty well, despite his son’s criticism
                    of them. Christopher Tolkien believes that the film adaptations were made as they were to appeal to the
                    sword-fight-loving crowd.</p>
                <li>Almost Snatched</li>
                    <p>Tolkien was born in Orange Free State, South Africa, and his family moved to England when he was three. When he was a
                    baby, he was kidnapped just for one day by a house-boy who was fascinated by him.</p>
                <li>Orphaned at a young age</li>
                    <p>Sadly, Tolkien’s parents died when he was young. He was only four when his father passed, and 12 when his mom died. He
                    and his brothers would be raised by a Catholic priest, as per his mother’s will. As a convert to Catholicism, she feared
                    her sons would be raised by her Protestant family members otherwise.</p>
